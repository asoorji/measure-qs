"question": "What is the mean of the following set of numbers: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11?",
"options": ["7", "6", "8", "9"],
"answerIndex": 1,
"explanation": "The mean of a set of numbers is equal to the sum of the numbers divided by the total number of numbers. So, in this case, the mean is (3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11) / 5 = 35 / 5 = 7."

"question": "What is the mean of the following data set: 5, 7, 10, 12, 8?",
"options": ["8", "9", "10", "11"],
"answerIndex": 1,
"explanation": "The mean is obtained by summing up all the values in the data set and dividing by the number of values. In this case, (5+7+10+12+8)/5 = 8.4, which rounds to 9. Therefore, the correct option is 9."

"question": "What is the median of the numbers 5, 7, 2, and 9?",
"options": ["2", "5", "7", "9"],
"answerIndex": 1,
"explanation": "The median of a set of numbers is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. In this case, the numbers arranged in order are 2, 5, 7, 9. The middle number is 5, so the median is 5."

"question": "What is the mode of the numbers 3, 4, 3, 5, and 3?",
"options": ["3", "4", "5", "There is no mode"],
"answerIndex": 0,
"explanation": "The mode of a set of numbers is the number that appears most frequently. In this case, the number 3 appears three times, while all the other numbers appear only once. Therefore, the mode is 3."

"question": "What is the range of the numbers 2, 5, 7, 10, and 12?",
"options": ["10", "12", "14", "15"],
"answerIndex": 3,
"explanation": "The range of a set of numbers is the difference between the largest and smallest numbers. In this case, the largest number is 12 and the smallest number is 2, so the range is 12 - 2 = 10."

"question": "What is the mean of the numbers 3, 6, 9, and 12?",
"options": ["5", "7", "9", "11"],
"answerIndex": 2,
"explanation": "The mean of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the total number of numbers. In this case, the sum of the numbers is 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 = 30, and there are four numbers. Therefore, the mean is 30/4 = 9."
